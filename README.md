# Stormpath-Rails-Gem

Stormpath is the first easy, secure user management and authentication service for developers. This is the Rails gem to ease integration of its features with any Rails-based application.

Stormpath makes it incredibly simple to add users and user data to your application. It aims to completely abstract away all user registration, login, authentication, and authorization problems, and make building secure websites painless.

## Installation

Add the following line to your Gemfile. Stormpath is currently in beta so it is necessary to include the gem version

```ruby
gem 'stormpath-rails', '~> 1.1.2.beta'
```

Bundle the Gemfile

```ruby
bundle install
```

Run the install script which will create a migration file and a config file.

```sh
rails generate stormpath:install
```

Migrate your database
```ruby
rake db:migrate
```

Create a stormpath account if you havent already, and be sure to set up environment variables

'STORMPATH_API_KEY_FILE_LOCATION' should be the location of your apiKey.properties file which you downloaded form stormpaths site
'STORMPATH_APPLICATION_HREF' should contain the href to your application, can also be found on stormpahs site

environment variables are set up in you .bashrc file or .zshrc if you use myzsh. So for example this should look something like this

```sh
export STORMPATH_API_KEY_FILE_LOCATION=~/.stormpathKey
export STORMPATH_APPLICATION_URL=https://api.stormpath.com/v1/applications/12345abc
```

environment variables can be named differently but the stormpath config file should be edited accordingly

also make sure that you have a root_path defined in your rails router.rb

## Configuration
Override any of these defaults in config/initializers/stormpath.rb

The following instance variables need to be set:

```ruby
ENV['STORMPATH_API_KEY_ID']
ENV['STORMPATH_API_KEY_SECRET']
```

If you have facebook directories, set the following env variables:

```ruby
ENV['STORMPATH_FACEBOOK_APP_ID']
ENV['STORMPATH_FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET']
```

If you're using google, you need to set:

```ruby
ENV['STORMPATH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID']
```

```ruby
Stormpath::Rails.configure do |config|
  config.api_key.file = ENV['STORMPATH_API_KEY_FILE_LOCATION']
  config.application.href = ENV['STORMPATH_APPLICATION_HREF']
end
```
The `STORMPATH_API_KEY_FILE_LOCATION` is the location of your Stormpath API Key file.  Information about getting this file is found in the [Ruby Quickstart](http://docs.stormpath.com/ruby/quickstart/).  The `STORMPATH_APPLICATION_HREF` represents the Application in Stormpath that is your Rails application.  You can get the href from the Stormpath Admin Console or the API.

## Useage

### Helper Methods

Use `current_user`, `signed_in?`, `signed_out?` in controllers, views, and helpers. For example:
```erb
<% if signed_in? %>
  <%= current_user.email %>
  <%= button_to "Sign out", sign_out_path, method: :delete %>
<% else %>
  <%= link_to "Sign in", sign_in_path %>
<% end %>
```

### Login

Stormpath Rails automaticly provides route to `/login`. If the attempt is successsfull, the user will be send to the next_uri whcih is by default `/` and create the propper session cookies.

If you wish to change this you can modify login options in configuration file:

```ruby
Stormpath::Rails.configure do |config|
  config.login do |c|
    c.enabled = true
    c.uri = '/login'
    c.next_uri = '/'
  end
end
```

### Logout
Stormpath Rails automaticly provides route to `/logout`.

If you wish to change the logout URI or the next_uri, you can provide the following configuration

```ruby
Stormpath::Rails.configure do |config|
  config.logout do |c|
    c.enabled = true
    c.uri = '/logout'
    c.next_uri = '/'
  end
end
```

### Verify Email

By default verify email is disabled. Which means after user fills in the registration form and submits, if his credentials are valid, he will be automaticly logged in without email verification.

If you want to enable email verification you can add the following code to the configuration file.  

```ruby
Stormpath::Rails.configure do |config|
  config.verify_email do |c|
    c.enabled = true
    c.uri = '/verify'
    c.next_uri = '/'
  end
end
```

If verify email set to enable after user registers he will first receive an email with the link and token with which he can verify his account. uri is the link which is used to verify the account and next_uri is location where user will be redirected after his account has been verified.

The email that is sent to the account is configurable through the Stormpath Admin Console.

### Forgot Password

By default forgot password is disabled. To enable it add the following code to the configuration file

```ruby
Stormpath::Rails.configure do |config|
  config.verify_email do |c|
    c.enabled = true
    c.uri = '/forgot'
  end
end
```

After the forgot password option has been enabled on the login form there will appear a link for user to reset his password. User first needs to enter an email to which a link will be send. When user clicks on a link he will be redirected to the final form where he can reset his password.

The email that is sent to the account is configurable through the Stormpath Admin Console.

### ID Site

If you'd like to not worry about building your own registration and login screens at all, you can use Stormpath's new [ID site](https://docs.stormpath.com/guides/using-id-site/) feature. This is a hosted login subdomain which handles authentication for you automatically.

To make ID Site work in Rails, you need to change stormpath configuration file:

```ruby
Stormpath::Rails.configure do |config|
  config.id_site do |c|
    c.enabled = true
    c.uri = "/redirect"
    c.next_uri = '/'
  end
end
```

When ID Site is enabled any request for `/login` or `/register` will cause a redirect to ID Site. When the user is finished at ID Site they will be redirected to uri which is defined in configuration, by default `/redirect`. Stormpath Rails will handle this request, and then redirect the user to `next_uri`

### Social Login

Stormpath Rails supports social login as well. Currently only Facebook is supported,  Providers for: Google, Github and Linkedin are currently in development.

In order to enable Facebook login you first you need to create a Facebook application and create a Facebook directory in your stormpath account. More info can be found [here](https://docs.stormpath.com/rest/product-guide/#integrating-with-facebook). After that you need to enable id from storm paths configuration file and provide facebook app_id and app_secret which is provided to you after Facebook app creation.

```ruby
Stormpath::Rails.configure do |config|
  config.facebook do |c|
    c.app_id = 'app_id'
    c.app_secret = 'app_secret'
  end
end
```

When user navigates to `/login` he will see a facebook login button. If he is authenticated succesfully he will be redirected back to rails root_path.

## Overriding Stormpath

### Routes
You can optionally run `rails generate stormpath:routes` to dump a copy of the default routes into your application for modification

```sh
rails generate stormpath:routes
```

### Controllers
To override a Stormpath controller, subclass it and update the routes to point to your new controller (see the "Routes" section).
```ruby
class PasswordsController < Stormpath::Rails::PasswordsController
class SessionsController < Stormpath::Rails::SessionsController
class UsersController < Stormpath::Rails::UsersController
```

### Views
You can use the stormpath views generator to copy the default views to your application for modification.
```sh
rails generate stormpath:views
```

```
app/views/layouts/stormpath.html.erb

app/views/passwords/edit.html.erb
app/views/passwords/email_sent.html.erb
app/views/passwords/forgot.html.erb
app/views/passwords/forgot_change.html.erb
app/views/passwords/forgot_change_failed.html.erb
app/views/passwords/forgot_complete.html.erb

```

## Development

### Prerequisites

If you wish to contribute to the gem, please follow the following steps:

1. Create a Stormpath Application.
2. Export the following env variables:
  - STORMPATH_API_KEY_ID
  - STORMPATH_API_KEY_SECRET

### Specs

Clone the repo & install the dependencies with `bundler install`.
The suite is written with RSpec, so to run the specs you'll need to execute `rspec`
The suite uses the [VCR gem](https://github.com/vcr/vcr) to record all the HTTP requests. On first roll it records them and after that all of the tests use the recorded HTTP requests and run under 10 seconds.
