Templates
=========


Default Views
-------------

By default this gem will use it's own templates for rendering its views.
The views that this gem serves by default (if the features are enabled) are:

* Login Page
* Registration Page
* Forgot Password Page
* Change Password Page
* Email Verification Page

If you want to customize these pages, there are two strategies.  You can install
our default templates and modify them

.. code-block:: ruby

    rails generate stormpath:views

or you can supply your own.


Custom Views
------------

If you want to supply your own view for a given feature, you need to let us
know where it is.  You do this by telling us the specific path to the file.
For example, if you had a folder named ``views`` in the root of your project,
you would declare it like this:

.. code-block:: ruby

      web:
        register:
          view: 'sessions/new.html.erb' // My custom login view


View Variables
--------------

Our gem will provide these view variables to all templates that are
rendered:

+-----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Variable**    | **Description**                                                   |
+-----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| current_account | The account object of the logged in user (undefined otherwise)    |
+-----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| signed_in?      | Boolean value which determines whether the user is signed in      |
|                 | or not                                                            |
+-----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+

You can also use the values from the ``stormpath.yml`` configuration file generated by this gem.
For example, if you want to iterate over all the fields that the register form contains you would do this by accessing:

.. code-block:: ruby

    Stormpath::Rails.config.web.register.form.fields

or if you just need to use a conditional statement:

.. code-block:: ruby

    Stormpath::Rails.config.web.change_password.enabled


Response Variables
------------------

Our gem will provide these objects on the response object for all JSON requests.

==========  ==========
Variable    Description

account     The account object of the logged in user (undefined otherwise)

.. code-block:: ruby

    {
      account: {
        href: account.href,
        username: account.username,
        modifiedAt: account.modified_at,
        status: account.status,
        createdAt: account.created_at,
        email: account.email,
        middleName: account.middle_name,
        surname: account.surname,
        givenName: account.given_name,
        fullName: account.full_name
      }
    }
